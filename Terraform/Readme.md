# Project README

This project contains Terraform configuration files to provision a multi-tier infrastructure on AWS. The infrastructure comprises an EC2 instance, a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both public and private subnets, and an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instance.

## Terraform Apply Output

Here's a snapshot of the output generated by Terraform apply:

## EC2 Instance

The EC2 instance provides compute capacity within the AWS environment. It serves as a web server, hosting applications or services accessible over the internet.

## VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

The VPC provides an isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources. It enables you to define a virtual network topology, including IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.

## Subnets

Subnets are segments of a VPC's IP address range that you can allocate to different resources. This project includes both public and private subnets within the VPC, ensuring proper segregation of resources based on their accessibility requirements.

## RDS Database

The RDS instance provides a managed relational database service, allowing you to easily set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. This project deploys an RDS instance to support data storage and retrieval for your applications.
