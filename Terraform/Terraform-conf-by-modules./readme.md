# Terraform Multi-Environment Infrastructure Deployment

This Terraform project allows you to deploy a multi-tier infrastructure consisting of a VPC with EC2 instances and RDS databases in different environments (dev and prod). It uses Terraform modules for reusable infrastructure components.

## Project Structure

.
Understood, let's reformat the file structure in a more readable way. Here it is:

```
.
├── dev
│   └── main.tf
├── modules
│   ├── ec2
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── outputs.tf
│   │   └── variables.tf
│   ├── rds
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── outputs.tf
│   │   └── variables.tf
│   └── vpc
│       ├── main.tf
│       ├── outputs.tf
│       └── variables.tf
├── prod
│   └── main.tf
├── README.md
└── terraform.tfstate
```

This structure provides a clear hierarchy and separates the different components of your Terraform project into their respective directories. Let me know if you need further assistance!

```

- `dev/`: Contains the Terraform configuration for the development environment.
- `prod/`: Contains the Terraform configuration for the production environment.
- `modules/`: Contains reusable Terraform modules for VPC, EC2, and RDS.
  - `ec2/`: Module for creating EC2 instances.
  - `rds/`: Module for provisioning RDS databases.
  - `vpc/`: Module for setting up VPC, subnets, and route tables.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
- `terraform.tfstate`: State file to track the state of the infrastructure.

## Usage

1. **Environment Configuration**: 
   - Navigate to the `dev/` or `prod/` directory.
   - Update the `main.tf` file to configure the environment-specific settings.
  
2. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Plan Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

## Modules

### VPC Module

- Creates a VPC with public and private subnets.

## Notes

- Ensure AWS credentials are configured properly for Terraform to access your AWS account.
- Review and adjust the Terraform configurations according to your specific requirements.
- Use caution when applying changes to production environments.
